-This project was meant to examine the effect of the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) on motor vehicle mortality rates across U.S. states, circa 1980. Much of the data follows a parallel trend assumption and as such, when controlling for differing state effects, we could exploit the data using a difference in difference framework to uncover the effect of varying MLDAâ€™s across states.

-The reference text (Masterming Metrics) is attached.

-The reference questions are attached.

-For questions 1, 2 and 3, the raw data was imported to excel and the plots were created using excel. Those files are attached.
