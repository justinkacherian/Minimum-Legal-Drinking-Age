-This project was meant to examine the effect of the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) on motor vehicle mortality rates across U.S. states, circa 1980. Much of the data follows a parallel trend assumption and as such, when controlling for differing state and time effects, we could exploit the data using a difference in difference framework to uncover the effect of varying MLDAâ€™s across states. One of the main purposes of the project was to exploit the variation of MLDA laws across states in a difference in difference framework. After preparing the data, I first used excel to create various plots showcasing this relationship, then used Stata to run several regressions while controlling for differences in time/year and controlling for fixed differences between states. The resulting regression estimates could then be used to summarize the effect that MLDA laws had on death rates, which puts into perspective why public policy opted to create a national minimum legal drinking age by 1984. The purpose of this project was to thoroughly interpret data in a difference in difference framework and demonstrate how these findings could then be used to create beneficial public policies.
